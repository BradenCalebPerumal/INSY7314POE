## ✨ 1. Project Overview and Introduction

### Introduction

This project involves the development of a secure customer-facing portal and an employee-facing portal with an accompanying API for an international bank's payment system. The customer portal allows users to register, log in, and initiate secure international payments. These payments are then stored in a secure database for further processing by pre-registered bank staff via the employee portal.

The system emphasizes robust, comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive financial information, ensuring compliance with best practices for data handling in a banking environment. Built using React for the frontend and a Node.js backend, the portal simulates real-world international transactions, primarily made to make use of SWIFT as the payment provider in regions like South Africa. The final system includes a DevSecOps pipeline with a CircleCI/SonarQube scan to ensure code quality and security hotspots are monitored before deployment

### Primary Goal

The primary goal is to create a complete, functional, and highly secure multi-portal system consisting of a customer interface and an employee payments processing interface. The entire system adheres to stringent security requirements, including password protection (hashing and salting) , strict input whitelisting , encrypted data transmission (SSL/TLS) , and comprehensive defenses against common web vulnerabilities like Session Jacking, SQL Injection, and DDoS attacks. Furthermore, the project demonstrates a commitment to quality and ongoing security by implementing a DevSecOps CI pipeline with a SonarQube scan to check for security hotspots and code smells. This ensures that customer data remains confidential, the system is resilient to potential threats, and code quality is maintained throughout the development lifecycle.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (via Vite), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Axios (for API requests).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (via Mongoose), Argon2/Bcrypt (for hashing), Zod (for validation), Helmet, CORS, Express-Rate-Limit, **Express-Brute**, Express-Session, Connect-Mongo, CSURF, Dotenv, Morgan, Winston, Cookie-Parser, UUID, HPP.
- **Testing**: Postman for API endpoint testing.
- **Security**: SSL/TLS for encrypted traffic (using self-signed certificates for development).
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for tracking code changes.
- **Stack**: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with separate `backend` and `frontend` folders under a single project root.

## 🛡️ 2. Security Implementation Highlights

Security is a core focus of these portals, with measures implemented to protect user data at every stage.  
All critical security logic is defined in modular, reusable components and verified on both client and server sides.

### Password Security

- **Strong Policy Enforcement**  
  A strict server-side password validation policy (`validatePassword`) is enforced with a live client-side strength meter using the zxcvbn library.  
  Implemented in:

  - `backend/src/auth/policy.js`
  - `frontend/src/lib/validators.js`
  - `frontend/src/components/PasswordStrength.jsx`

- **Secure Hashing and Peppering**  
  Passwords are hashed using Argon2 (or Bcrypt as fallback) and peppered with a secret `PWD_PEPPER` value stored securely in `.env`.  
  Implemented in `backend/src/auth/policy.js` and `backend/.env`.

- **Rotation & Invalidation**  
  Password changes and resets trigger JWT session invalidation via primary/secondary version (pv/sv) tokens to ensure old sessions are revoked.  
  Implemented in `backend/src/routes/auth.js`.

- **Reset Tokens & Enumeration Safety**  
  Reset tokens are single-use, short-lived, and hashed with SHA-256, preventing reuse or guessing. The reset flow resists account enumeration.  
  Implemented in `backend/src/routes/auth.js` and `backend/src/models/PasswordReset.js`.

**Verdict:** Meets → _Exceeds_ (strong policy, peppering, rotation, and reset hygiene).

### Input Whitelisting and Sanitization

- **Strict Allow-List Validation**  
  Regex-based input validation ensures only allowed formats are accepted for IDs, account numbers, usernames, SWIFT codes, currencies, and amounts.  
  Implemented in:

  - `backend/src/validation/fields.js`
  - `frontend/src/lib/validators.js`

- **Unicode Sanitizer**  
  Invisible and control characters are stripped globally using a Unicode sanitizer middleware.  
  Implemented in `backend/src/middleware/unicodeSanitizer.js`.

- **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) Protection**  
  The backend prevents multi-parameter attacks via the `hpp()` middleware.  
  Configured in `backend/src/app.js`.

- **Server-Side Validation as Source of Truth (SoT)**  
  Every request in `/auth/` and `/payments/` is revalidated on the server, ensuring frontend bypass attempts fail.  
  Implemented across `backend/src/routes/*`.

**Verdict:** Exceeds expectations (sanitizer + HPP + mirrored validation).

### Securing Data in Transit (SSL/TLS)

- **Full HTTPS Enforcement**  
  The API runs on port `4001` using HTTPS, with an HTTP→HTTPS redirector on port `4000`.  
  Configured in `backend/src/server.js`.

- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**  
  Configured via **Helmet** to ensure browsers always use HTTPS, with preload-ready headers.  
  Implemented in `backend/src/app.js`.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**  
  Defines strict `connect-src` (allowing API & reCAPTCHA) and `referrerPolicy`.  
  Implemented in `backend/src/app.js`.

**Verdict:** Meets standard requirements; secure in dev and production.

### Protection Against Common Attacks

- **Helmet Security Suite:** CSP, frame/obj/style restrictions, CORP, and Permissions-Policy headers.  
  (`backend/src/app.js`)

- **CORS with Allow-List and Preflight Handling:**  
  Only approved origins can access API routes, with credentials enabled.  
  (`backend/src/app.js`, `backend/src/config/env.js`)

- **Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection:**

  - Global and route-specific limits implemented using **Express-Rate-Limit**.
  - **Express-Brute** adds an extra layer of brute-force defense with memory store tracking failed attempts and imposing exponential backoff on repeated login failures.  
    (`backend/src/app.js`, `backend/src/routes/auth.js`)

- **reCAPTCHA v2 Integration:**  
  Login and Register forms use Google reCAPTCHA to block bots and credential-stuffing.  
  (`backend/src/middleware/recaptcha.js`, `frontend/src/components/ReCaptchaBox.jsx`)

- **JWT Security Best Practices:**  
  Short-lived access tokens and secure HttpOnly refresh cookies (`SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in prod). Tokens are invalidated after password changes.  
  (`backend/src/routes/auth.js`)

- **Brute Force Telemetry:**  
  Failed login counters are reset upon successful authentication.  
  (`backend/src/routes/auth.js`)

- **Email Enumeration Resistance:**  
  “Forgot password” routes give uniform responses regardless of email existence.  
  (`backend/src/routes/auth.js`)

- **Sensitive Data Encryption at Rest:**  
  Account numbers are encrypted using a symmetric key (`DATA_KEY`).  
  (`backend/src/utils/crypto.js`)

**Verdict:** Exceeds requirements (comprehensive coverage).

## 🔒 3. DevSecOps CI Pipeline

A secure DevSecOps pipeline ensures quality and safety throughout development and deployment.

### Minimum Implementations:

- **Implemented CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a GitHub repository with a CircleCI pipeline to run a SonarQube scan to check for hotspots and code smells.
- GitHub Actions pipeline to run on each Pull Request:
  - `npm ci`, lint, unit tests, build, and `npm audit` for vulnerabilities.
- Enable **GitHub secret scanning** or **Gitleaks** to detect leaked credentials.

### Exceeded Implementations:

- Add **SAST/DAST and dependency scans** (e.g., Semgrep, Trivy, Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check).
- Containerize app, scan Docker image, and push to a secure registry.
- Run a **ZAP Baseline Scan** against deployed previews.
- Fail pipeline on high-severity findings and artifact the scan reports.

**Verdict:** The required CircleCI/SonarQube pipeline is implemented, and planned enhancements aim to achieve a fully automated and auditable CI/CD flow, exceeding the base security requirements.

### Security Verdict Summary

| Category           | Implementation Status                                 | Verdict                       |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |

## 🚀 4. Features and Functionality

The final project provides a streamlined and secure multi-portal experience for both customers and pre-registered bank employees.

- **Customer Registration:**
  Users register with validated personal data (name, ID, account number, password). Passwords are hashed, peppered, and validated for strength.

- **Customer Login:**
  Secure login with session management via JWT, Express-Brute, and reCAPTCHA protection.

- **International Payment Submission:**
  Customers can enter an amount, select currency, choose a provider (like SWIFT), and submit payment details.

- **Employee Login (Static):**
  Employees are pre-registered and must log in using static, pre-configured accounts. No registration process is possible for employee accounts.

- **Employee Portal Functionality:**
  The portal displays submitted international transactions. Employees can check the payee's account information, verify the SWIFT code, and finalize the process by clicking a "verified" button.

- **Finalizing Transaction:**
  The employee completes the transaction by clicking "submit to SWIFT".

- **Secure Data Storage & Transit:**
  Transactions are stored securely in MongoDB with encryption for sensitive fields. All communication for both portals is served over HTTPS/SSL with HSTS and CSP enforcement.

    - Example content:
      ```
      PORT=4000
      MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/paymentsdb
      SESSION_SECRET=your_long_random_secret
      FRONTEND_URL=https://localhost:5173
      HTTPS_KEY_PATH=./certs/localhost-key.pem
      HTTPS_CERT_PATH=./certs/localhost.pem
      NODE_ENV=development
      ```
    - Replace values (e.g., MongoDB connection string) as needed.

5.  **Set up SSL for Local Development:**
    - Create an OpenSSL config file (e.g., `localhost.cnf`) with Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries.
    - Generate a self-signed certificate:
      ```bash
      openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/localhost-key.pem -out certs/localhost.pem -config localhost.cnf -extensions v3_req
      ```
    - **Trust the certificate** in your browser/OS to avoid repeated warnings.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend** (from the `backend` folder):

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    (Uses Nodemon for automatic server reloading.)

2.  **Start the Frontend** (from the `frontend` folder in a separate terminal):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    (The Vite server runs on port 5173 by default.)

### Usage Instructions

## ❓ 10. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Why is SSL used in development?

To simulate production security and ensure all data in transit is encrypted from the start, preventing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks even locally. This fulfills the Task 3 requirement that all traffic is served over SSL.

### 2. How do I handle certificate warnings in the browser?

For self-signed certificates, you must add an exception in your browser or manually trust the certificate in your operating system's keychain. In production environments, you must use a CA-signed certificate.

### 3. What if the MongoDB connection fails?

Check your `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file and ensure the MongoDB service is running. For a local setup, the URI should typically be `mongodb://localhost:27017/paymentsdb`.

### 4. How are user sessions managed?

Sessions are stored in MongoDB using the `connect-mongo` library, with secure cookies enforced to transmit only over HTTPS.

### 5. Can I test without a real SWIFT integration?

Yes, the system simulates the submission of international payments. Transactions are stored in the database but do not make actual external calls to the SWIFT network or other providers.

### 6. What if I encounter dependency issues?

First, try running `npm install` again in both the `backend` and `frontend` folders. If the issue persists, check your Node.js version compatibility against the project's requirements.

### 7. How are employee accounts created since registration is disabled?

Employee accounts are pre-configured and statically defined in the backend's configuration/database setup. This adheres to the Task 3 requirement that users are created and no registration process is possible for bank staff.

### 8. What is the purpose of the SonarQube scan?

The SonarQube scan, run via the CircleCI pipeline, performs Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Its purpose is to check the codebase for security hotspots and code smells (quality issues) _before_ deployment, enforcing high standards of code security and maintainability.

### 9. How is input validation achieved against all attacks?

The system enforces security via multiple layers, with a primary defense being strict whitelisting using RegEx patterns on all input fields in both the customer and employee portals. This white-list approach is the strongest defense against injection attacks like SQLi and XSS.
