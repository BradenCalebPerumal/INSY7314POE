# MERN International Payments Portal (Task 2 Starter)

This repository scaffolds a **Customer International Payments Portal** using **MERN**:
- **MongoDB** (via Mongoose)
- **Express** (Node.js API)
- **React** (Vite + TypeScript)
- **Node.js** runtime

The project is split into two apps:
- `backend/` → API (Express + TypeScript) with security middleware and a health endpoint.
- `frontend/` → React (Vite + TypeScript) with a basic router and placeholder pages.

> This is a starting point for step‑by‑step implementation: we’ll add auth, password policy, regex validation, TLS, CAPTCHA, payments, and CI as we go.
